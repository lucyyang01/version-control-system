# Version Control System

## Description

This is my implementation of a version control system inspired by Git. This system supports most core functionalities provided by Git, such as repository creation, branching, merging, logs, and merge conflict detection. This project was built in Java and utilizes multiple data structures and algorithms to enable efficient handling of large files, as well as serialization for persistence. A short write-up of the design of this system can be found in the gitlet-design.md file.

The full list of supported commands include: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.

## Collaborators

This project was completed with my partner, Alex Bovenzi, as part of UC Berkeley's Data Structures course.
