# Version Control System

## Description

This is my implementation of a version control system inspired by Git. This system supports most core functionalities provided by Git, such as repository creation, branching, merging, logs, and merge conflict detection. This project was built in Java and utilizes multiple data structures and algorithms to enable efficient handling of large files.

Some features that could be implemented in the future to improve this project would be the ability to create remote repositories and implementing a conflict resolution protocol for users.

## Design

A detailed write up of the design of this system can be found in the gitlet-design.md file. 

## Instructions for Use

TODO

## Collaborators

This project was completed with my partner, Alex Bovenzi, as part of UC Berkeley's Data Structures course.
